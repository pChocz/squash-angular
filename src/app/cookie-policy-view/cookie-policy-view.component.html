            <li>
                We use cookies in order to keep you logged in, otherwise you would need to type your password on each
                request.
            </li>
            <li>
                Of course it doesn't mean that we store your credentials. Only the JWT (token) is stored within the app
                and it's not possible to extract credentials from it.
            </li>
            <li>
                We also keep <i>'confirm-cookie-consent'</i> cookies (so called cookie-ception), to make sure that the
                cookie consent will not show up again after accepting the policy.
            </li>
        </ul>

        The end of cookie policy. I'm glad that you spent your time reading it. Enjoy using the app!

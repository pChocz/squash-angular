                    We use cookies in order to keep you logged in, otherwise you would need to type your password on
                    each request.

                <li>
                    Of course it doesn't mean that we store your credentials. Only the JWT (token) is stored within
                    the app and it's not possible to extract credentials from it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We also keep <i>'confirm-cookie-consent'</i> cookies, to make sure that the
                    cookie consent will not show up again after accepting the policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Service worker related cookies are also kept, as the application is a Progressive Web App (PWA).
